# pyquiz

This is a domain-specific language for authoring Canvas quizzes.  It
is designed for with an eye toward
1. making it easy to have a ready library of questions to create new quizzes and
2. making it easy to generate variants of questions (making use of question groups).

The way in which quiz questions are authored is somewhat inspired by
WeBWorK.

Pyquiz has been used for a variety of classes at UC Berkeley, including
* the 2021-2023 summer sessions of Math 54 and
* the 2022 summer session of PHILOS W12A.
